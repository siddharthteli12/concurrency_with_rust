### Flavours with channel: 
- Synchronous channels: Channel where send can block. Limited capacity.
    - Mutex + Condvar + VecDeque. Send will block if queue is full.
    - Atomic VecDeque (atomic queue) without mutex. For wakefull we can use thread::park + Thread::notify.
- Asynchronous channels: Channel where send cannot block. Unlimited capacity.
    - Issue can be sender can be much faster then receiver leading to low consumption & high production.
    - Mutex + Condvar + VecDeque (VecDeque has issue of resizing when new item is added)
    - To avoid resizing, Mutex + Condvar + LinkedList
    - Atomic LinkedList
    - Atomic block LinkedList used in crossbeam.
- Rendezvous channels: Synchronous with capacity = 0. Used for thread synchronization.
- Oneshot channels: Any capacity. In practice, only to call send once.
